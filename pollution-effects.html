                    <h1>Effects of Plastic Pollution</h1>
                    <p>
                        Plastic pollution is a problem that affects us and can be seen all over the world.
                        It reduces biodiversity and the ability for many ecosystems to adapt to climate change by altering habitats and natural processes, directly affecting millions of people's livelihoods and well-being, the food we eat, and much more.
                        The ocean is highly polluted by plastic, with things like plastic bags or nets floating around the ocean or on the sea floor.
                        Marine animals often mistake it for food or become entangled in it, resulting in injury or death.
                        As plastics break down into microplastics and are eaten by marine animals, they become part of the food chain, which results in ecosystems being damaged and polluted by plastic.
                        Plastic pollution is also a big problem on land, with plastics able to be found almost everywhere.
                        It pollutes the streets and forests, and clogs drainage systems.
                        Plastic pollution also massively contributes to climate change, as plastics are made mainly through fossil fuels, and release large amounts of carbon emissions.
                        The extraction and transportation of fossil fuels, manufacturing and disposal of plastics, all produce harmful emissions responsible for global warming.
