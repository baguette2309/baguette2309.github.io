                        The Three R's are Reduce, Reuse, and Recycle. These three principles are a guide to minimizing plastic waste and promoting a more sustainable lifestyle.
                        By implementing these princpiles into your daily life, you will contribute to help against plastic pollution and climate change.
                        Read more details about each of the Three R's below, what they contribute to, and how you can do them as well.

                            <h2>Reduce</h2>
                            <p>
                                The first out of the Three R's, Reduce, is about minimizing the amount of plastic that we use to lower the generation of plastic entirely, reducing the overall amount of plastic waste being created.
                                You can reduce your plastic use by buying less plastic items, products which use less plastic packaging, or by choosing more sustainable options or items.

                            <h2>Reuse</h2>
                            <p>
                                The next out of the Three R's is Reuse. It is about finding ways to use items more than once instead of discarding them after a single use, reducing the amount of plastic waste that is dumped.
                                You can reuse by using reusable shopping bags or containers, using refillable water bottles instead of plastic water bottles, or donating or selling unwanted plastic items to be used again by someone else.

                            <p>
                                The last out of the Three R's is Recycle. It involves recycling plasting waste and other used materials by processing them into new products like clothes, bags, packaging materials, and many other items which can be newly used again.
                                You probably already recycle, but you can do it by putting recyclable plastic waste (generally hard plastics instead of soft plastics) and other materials like paper and cardboard into the recycle bin instead of rubbish bin.
                                You can see if your plastic is recyclable by checking for a recycling symbol with a number inside, and check if that number is recyclable in your local area.
