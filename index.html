                <h3>Lily of the Valley</h3>
                
                <p>
                    Lily of the valley (Convallaria majalis) is a plant with small bell-shaped white flowers that grow in clusters in spring.
                    Native to the Northern Hemisphere in Asia and Europe, it typically grows in cool temperate regions in woodland environments with moist soil and partial shade.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Since there is a high concentration of cardiac glycosides (cardenolides) in the flower, it is highly poisonous if consumed by humans or other animals.
                </p>

                <h3>Other Names</h3>
                <p>
                    Other names include May bells, Our Lady's tears, and Mary's tears. Its French name, muguet, sometimes appears in the names of perfumes imitating the flower's scent.
                    In pre-modern England, the plant was known as glovewort (as it was a wort used to create a salve for sore hands), or Apollinaris (according to a legend that it was discovered by Apollo).

                <h3>Description</h3>
                <p>
                    Lily of the valley (Convallaria majalis) is a perennial herb that spreads by underground stems known as rhizomes, often forming large clusters.
                    During the summer, new vertical shoots called "pips" develop at the ends of horizontal stems called stolons.
                    These pips stay dormant until spring, when they grow into leafy shoots that remain connected underground.
                    The plant's stems typically reach a height of 15–30 cm (6–12 inches) and usually have one or two leaves measuring 10–25 cm (4–10 inches) long.
                    Flowering stems bear two leaves and a cluster (raceme) of five to fifteen flowers at the top.
